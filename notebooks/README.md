# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebook overviews of the PiEdge EduKit labs.

## Lab Overview

- **Lab 1**: Training and ONNX Export
- **Lab 2**: Latency Benchmarking
- **Lab 2b**: Quantization Comparison (Bonus)
- **Lab 3**: GPIO Control with Hysteresis

## Usage

For the complete self-contained lesson experience, use the CLI commands as described in `index.html`:

```bash
bash run_lesson.sh
```

The notebooks provide additional context and explanations, but the core lesson is designed to run entirely from the command line for maximum reproducibility.

## Interactive Exploration

If you want to explore the code interactively:

1. Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
2. Open the lab notebooks in this directory
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions

Note: The lesson verification (`python verify.py`) requires CLI execution, so notebooks are supplementary to the main lesson flow.
